This is an exploratory project for me, but feel free to contribute! I welcome suggestions in any and all areas:

* Improving efficiency of the engine
* Recommendations on how to write JavaScript better
* Additional avatars and textures
* Seriously, anything

Simply fork my repo, commit your changes to your fork, and send me a pull request. Thanks for checking out the project!
